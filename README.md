## üìä Scientific Learning Algorithm

### Enhanced SM2 Spaced Repetition System
Based on the proven **SM2 (SuperMemo 2)** algorithm with modern enhancements:

- **ACQUISITION Phase** (Levels 1-4): Cumulative progression system
  - Quality-based bonuses: Good (+1 day), Very Easy (+2 days), Hard (no change), Forgotten (reset to 1 day)
  - Smooth transitions to maintenance phase at Level 5
  
- **MAINTENANCE Phase** (Level 5+): Dynamic SM2 algorithm
  - Ease factor adjustments based on recall difficulty
  - Exponential interval growth for long-term retention
  - Intelligent transition preservation from acquisition intervals

- **FOCUS Mode**: Intensive practice with gamification
  - XP-based progression system with quality rewards
  - Daily practice suggestions for accelerated learning
  - Automatic transition back to maintenance after 7 days of inactivity

### Dual-Mode Scheduling
- **Daily Mode**: Traditional daily intervals for home practice
